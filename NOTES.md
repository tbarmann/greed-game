* Get familiar with the basic STDIN/STDOUT methods of `puts`, `print` & `gets`
  (don't forget about `#chomp` also)

* Get familiar with the `rand` method for generating random numbers, and also
  the `srand` method for seeding your "randomness" with repeatable results
  for testing & debugging purposes.

* Do yourself a favor, and also write some good tests to not only gain practice
  in writing tests, but also to give you some sanity checking for the game and
  scoring flow

* Some initial tests and bare classes have been provided for you.  You can
  modify these as you see fit, add new classes and modules and do generally
  anything else.  These are only provided as a starting point.  Anything outside
  of the `greed.rb` file can be modified.

* Make sure to display/log useful information to the client as the game
  progresses so they can follow along.
